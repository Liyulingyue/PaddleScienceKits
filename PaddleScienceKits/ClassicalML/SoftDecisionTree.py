"""Soft / differentiable decision tree (Frosst 2017) re-implemented
as a ``paddle.nn.Layer``.

A tree of depth ``d`` has ``n_inner = 2^d - 1`` inner nodes and
``n_leaves = 2^d`` leaves. Each inner node carries a learnable linear
filter ``w ∈ R^{n_features}`` and bias ``b ∈ R``; the probability of
routing a sample to its *left* child is

    p_left = sigmoid(temperature * (x . w + b))

and the routing distribution is a soft binary tree. The output is
the expected class distribution: a weighted sum of the (learnable)
per-leaf class distributions, with weights equal to the leaf
posterior.

The whole computation is a single backprop-friendly graph.
