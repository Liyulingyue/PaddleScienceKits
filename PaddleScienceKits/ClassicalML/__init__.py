"""ClassicalML submodule: classical ML models re-implemented as
``paddle.nn.Layer`` so they can be composed with deep networks.

Currently hosts:

* :class:`KMeans`            — centroids as learnable parameters; soft or
  hard assignment; standard Lloyd updates during ``fit``.
* :class:`KNN`               — non-parametric memory layer; top-k
  retrieval and average-pool reconstruction.
* :class:`PCA`               — orthonormal basis as a learnable
  parameter; project / reconstruct; SVD-based fitting.
* :class:`KernelRidge`       — dual-form linear-in-memory model with
  RBF / linear / polynomial kernels.
* :class:`GMM`               — Gaussian mixture with learnable means,
  log-variances, and weights; EM fitting; differentiable soft
  responsibilities.
* :class:`LDA`               — Fisher linear discriminant analysis with
  closed-form eigen solve.
* :class:`GaussianNB`        — per-class Gaussian Naive Bayes with
  MLE-estimated mean / variance.
* :class:`MultinomialNB`     — multinomial Naive Bayes for count
  features with Laplace smoothing.
* :class:`ICA`               — FastICA fixed-point source separation
  with whitening.
* :class:`SoftDecisionTree`  — Frosst 2017 differentiable decision
  tree with sigmoid inner nodes and per-leaf class distributions.
* :class:`BayesianRidge`     — Bayesian linear regression with
  marginal-likelihood maximisation; full predictive distribution.
* :class:`SVM`               — LS-SVM with kernelised RBF / linear /
  polynomial kernels and one-vs-rest multi-class extension.
* :class:`GaussianProcess`   — GP regression with RBF / Matérn-3/2 /
  Matérn-5/2 / linear / polynomial kernels and learnable
  hyperparameters.
* :class:`GaussianHMM`       — categorical-emission hidden Markov
  model with closed-form EM (Baum-Welch).
* :class:`KalmanFilter`      — Linear Dynamical System with
  Kalman filtering / RTS smoothing and closed-form EM.
* :class:`LinearChainCRF`    — linear-chain CRF with
  forward-backward training and Viterbi decode.
* :class:`tSNE`              — Student-t SNE embedding with
  early-exaggeration and Adam-based KL minimisation.
* :class:`SparseCoding`     — dictionary learning with a learnable
  ``[n_atoms, n_features]`` matrix and ISTA / FISTA encoder.
* :class:`BayesianLinearVI` — Bayesian linear regression with
  mean-field variational inference over the weights, reparameterised
  samples, and an analytical KL term.
* :class:`tICA`              — Time-lagged Independent Component
  Analysis (slow-modes projection) with closed-form generalised
  eigen solve.
* :class:`NMF`               — Non-negative matrix factorisation
  with Lee-Seung multiplicative updates and NNDSVD init.
* :class:`GMMHMM`            — Gaussian-Mixture-emission HMM
  (continuous observations, Baum-Welch EM).
* :class:`ProbabilisticPCAMixture` — mixture of probabilistic PCA
  with closed-form EM per cluster (Tipping & Bishop 1999).
* :class:`SparseGP`            — variational sparse Gaussian Process
  with Titsias 2009 ELBO and learnable inducing points.
* :class:`SpectralClustering`  — Ng-Jordan-Weiss spectral clustering
  with RBF affinity and symmetric normalised graph Laplacian.
* :class:`RBM`                 — Bernoulli Restricted Boltzmann Machine
  with CD-k training and free-energy evaluation.
* :class:`IsingModel`          — 2-D Ising model with single-spin
  Gibbs sampling under periodic boundary conditions.
